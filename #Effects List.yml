#
#   « Examples »

#
#   « Explanation »
#     Basic format for this flag is "<aoe> radius=<radius> target=<target> </aoe>"
#     ► Radius: Any number which is > 0 (1, 2, ...)
#     ► Target: Targetted players, possibile targets:
#       -> all (all players in radius)
#
#       -> damageable (all players in radius which CAN be damaged by enchantment owner. This should be compatible with most plugins)
#         (Example usage: Can allow AOE (area of damage) to inflict damage to all enemied faction players in radius, since player can damage them)
#
#       -> undamageable (all players in radius which CANNOT be damaged by enchantment owner. This should be compatible with most plugins)
#         (Example usage: Can be used to heal all faction members in radius, since player cannot damage them)
#

#  Chance (Number)
#    Chance of effect occurring

#  Cooldown (number)
#    Number of effect cooldown, in seconds.

# Conditions
#   Conditions let you choose under what circumstances enchantment should be activated/stopped or chance increased/descreased
#
#   « Examples »
#      ► '%victim health% > 5 : %stop%' (Will not activate effects if player's health is higher than 2.5 hearts (1 heart = 2)
#      ► '%player world% = my_world : %allow%' (If player is in world called "my_world", the enchantment will activate)
#      ► '%player y% < 30 && %player health% > 10 =  : %chance%+10' (If player's Y level is less than 30 and health is more than 5 hearts, it 7
#      will increase chance of effects activating by 10)
#      ► '%victim health% > %attacker health% : %force%' (If victim has more health than attacker, effects will be forced to run
#      ignoring probability chance of it activating).
#
#   « Variables for conditional part »
#    %player health%, %player food%, %player_world%, %player_name%, %player x, %player y%, %player z%, %near players% (number)
#    You can also replace "player" with attacker/victim for ATTACK, BOW, DEATH, DEFENSE and KILL_PLAYER enchantment types.
#    %block x%, %block y% and %block z% can be used for MINING enchantment type. %combo%, %attacker combo% and %victim combo% can
#    be used to define how many combo's player has. You can also use %is sneaking% as well as %attacker is sneaking%, %victim is sneaking%
#    (eg. %is sneaking% = true : %continue%) As well as %is on fire%, can be used with %victim/attacker is on fire% (returns true/false)
#    You can use %mob type% variable for KILL_MOB and ATTACK_MOB, to get mob in the event, e.g.: (CREEPER, CAVE_SPIDER, ZOMBIE)
#    %block type% - Mined block type, find all block types at: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html
#    %(victim/attacker)is under water% - returns "true/false"
#    %is headshot% - returns "true/false" (for BOW)
#    %has potion effect <POTION EFFECT TYPE>% - returns "true/false"
#    %(attacker /victim )faction land% - returns ENEMY, NEUTRAL, TRUCE, MEMBER (own land) (Factions)
#    %(attacker /victim )level of skill (mcmmo skill(UpperCase))% - returns level number (mcMMO)
#    %(attacker /victim )is bleeding% - returns "true/false" if player is bleeding (mcMMO)
#    %damaged from behind% - returns if victim was damaged from behind by enemy
#    %attacker has enchantment in hand of <enchant>% - returns "true/false", checks if player has enchantment on their item
#    %attacker time%/%victim time% - get player world time
#    %health percentage% - get player's health percentage
#    %victim/attacker custom name% - get mob's name
#    %potion effect level <potion name>% - get level of applied potion effect, remember that potion amplifiers are counted from 0, so level 1 = 0
#    %<player> can break% - checks if player can break specified block, can be used with MINING and SWING, returns true/false
#    %<player> is holding% - returns material of held item
#
# PLACHOLDERAPI SUPPORT FOR CONDITIONS:
#    E.g: '%victim player_level% > 10 : %stop%', player_level is a PlaceholderAPI condition %player_level%. You can use %player <condition>%, %attacker <condition>% and %victim <condition>%.
#    It's a must to remove percentage signs from PlaceholderAPI placeholders, more examples: %server_online% -> server_online -> '%player server_online% > 5 : %allow%'
#
#   « Variables for end solution »
#    %force% (forces effect to activate ignoring chance), %continue% (let's the effect reading continue, takes chance in consideration),
#    %stop% (ignores all of the effects), %chance%+x (increases chance by x%), %chance-x% (decreases chance by x%)
